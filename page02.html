            <h1>30 min Psychic Reading with Francis $65.00</h1>
            <p>In these readings I can either start with a focused question or two, or I can tap into the clients energy psychically and pick up on major themes going on in their life, and offer guidance and an objective perspective. These readings can include suggestions for meditation and ritual to further integrate the lessons and themes going on in a person’s life, if the client is wanting that. That aspect of the reading is optional.</p>

            <p>If you feel dissatisfied and struggle to move forward, but simply can’t figure it out – this session can help bring it all into perspective. In this reading, I’ll connect to your Spirit Guides for clarity and insight into specific circumstances, issues and challenges that pull you out of alignment with the goals of your soul, and what can be done to bring you back on track. Spirit Guide Readings are question & answer based, not cold readings.</p>
